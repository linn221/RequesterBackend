GET /requests/1 is returning null response_headers. check if import har file not working or fetching the request detail.
add original_filename field in attachments listing type in endpoint, programs, requests, etc.
I want to add hash fieds in Request Listing DTO.
Add url query named search in /requests (request listing api) that will do search with LIKE operation in request body/header, response body/header. Then, from the resulting results, extract the matched string (with some extra text for the context), and put them in search_results array field.
After the updates to DTOs, also modify the openapi spec to relect the API.
